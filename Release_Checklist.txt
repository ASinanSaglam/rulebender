    Two non-essential changes have been made to Prefuse before building 
the Prefuse .jar file:

    1)  Line number 497 of the file  ExpressionParser.java  has been
        commented out as follows:

            //  s_logger.info("Parsed Expression: "+e);

        This stops the printing of certain informational messages from
        Prefuse.

    2)  In the file  EdgeRenderer.java,  the method setBounds(VisualItem item)
        has been modified as follows:

        The lines:

         if ( m_curArrow != null ) {
            Rectangle2D bbox = (Rectangle2D)item.get(VisualItem.BOUNDS);
            Rectangle2D.union(bbox, m_curArrow.getBounds2D(), bbox);
         }

         Are now:

         if ( m_curArrow != null ) {
            Rectangle2D bbox = (Rectangle2D)item.get(VisualItem.BOUNDS);
            if ( 1 == 0 ) {
                Rectangle2D.union(bbox, m_curArrow.getBounds2D(), bbox);
            }
         }

         By commenting out the second line of the stanza, the effect of
         the stanza has been changed.  But since the stanza seems to be a
         no-op anyway, I decided to just eliminate the line.

         The proper way to handle this would be to calculate the space
         consumed by the arrowhead, and add that space correctly to the
         space required by the visual item.  The calculation would be 
         the union of the space required by the arrow head and the space
         required by the visual item.
